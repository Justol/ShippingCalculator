## üîÑ Carrier Integration Process
### Architecture
- Implemented a modular carrier client system
- Each carrier (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL) has its own client class
- Common interfaces ensure consistent API across carriers
- Factory pattern for client instantiation

### Implementation Details
1. **Base Structure**
   - Common types and interfaces in `types.ts`
   - Carrier-specific implementations in separate files
   - Factory class for client creation

2. **Authentication**
   - OAuth2 flow for UPS, FedEx, and DHL
   - API key authentication for USPS
   - Token management with automatic refresh

3. **Rate Calculation**
   - Standardized rate request format
   - Dimension and weight normalization
   - Currency conversion handling
   - Transit time calculation

4. **Pickup Management**
   - Scheduling system for each carrier
   - Confirmation handling
   - Status tracking
   - Time window management

### Testing & Validation
- Sandbox environment testing
- Error case handling
- Rate comparison validation
- Response transformation testing

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Unit tests for carrier API clients
- [ ] Integration tests for main components
- [ ] E2E testing setup
- [ ] API error handling improvements
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton screens
